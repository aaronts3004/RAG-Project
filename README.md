# RAG-Project
Currently implementing a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) System.<br>
A RAG can enhance the precision and relevance of the responses from a Large Language Model (LLM) 
thanks to the embedding of a local context that the LLM is made aware of. 

1. Data ingestion pipeline modules: "transcript_utils.py", "channel_utils.py"
2. Supportive modules: "database.py" for database operations; "youtube_api.py" for setting up API keys
